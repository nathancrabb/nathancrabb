<p>This job caught my eye as It seems like a great company to work for.  The job is located nearby in a great neighbourhood.  The job requires a number of programming skills (nearly all of which I donâ€™t have yet and a few I have never heard of).  Has a great employee relationship with a gym and a free meal once a week.  It looks like they do a lot of work with various companies, including woolworths of which I use and are quite happy with there app and service.  Some of the skills I already have are, Multicoloured mouse, multicoloured mouse pad, TWO extra monitors on my computer, Light up sound bar under monitor oh and a gaming chair.  LOL
But seriously </p>
