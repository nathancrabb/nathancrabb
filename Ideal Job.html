<p1>This job caught my eye as It seems like a great company to work for.  The job is located nearby in a great neighbourhood.  The job requires a number of programming skills (nearly all of which I donâ€™t have yet and a few I have never heard of).  Has a great employee relationship with a gym and a free meal once a week.  It looks like they do a lot of work with various companies, including Woolworths of which I use and are quite happy with there insurance app and service.  
<br><br>Some of the skills I already have are, Multicoloured mouse, multicoloured mouse pad, TWO extra monitors on my computer, Light up sound bar under monitor oh and a gaming chair.  LOL<br><br>

But seriously it sounds great, working as a secret double agent, breaking into top corporations.  Protecting and encrypting the stuff that is there so that even if they do get in, minimal damage is done.  Even the stuff you learn sounds cool like OWASP.  This all starts from the beginning, when you switch on your computer you enter a password.  Then when you are on the net you have a firewall.  Transactions are encrypted.  
<br><br>One of the key points is 4 years working in Cyber Security.  This is well within my timeframe as I am not looking at switching careers for another 5 to 10 years.  RMIT has a few ways of getting qualified as a cyber security analyst and this is a career that is developing fast.  Also It is constant learning as more technology leaves us open to more attacks and new defences from various fronts.
