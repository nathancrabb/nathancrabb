<p1>Conclusions

Well it looks like I’m a visual learner who follows my own path and need to improve on my creativity.  These tests don’t feel like they have much depth, although the 16 personalities test seems to be spot on and there is the ability to take on more tests.  I have never taken a test such as this before and they seem to provide some insight as to what kind of person I am and which ways allow me to learn more efficiently.
