		When I was around eight my father brought home a ZX81 computer.  I taught myself to program it using books from the library.  It was incredibly slow so I would set it up to load before school so it would be ready when i got home.  It was also very fragile, if you knocked it hard it would crash, I mainly played a shoot-em up and a block breaker and mucked around with simple programs.  Eventually I graduated to a commodore 64 and then an Amiga and 286, these were in colour and much quicker and advanced.  I was more interested in how these machines worked and loved to copy programs in from various books.  Had a pretty good knowledge of MSDOS and win 3.14.  
		After leaving school I really had nothing more to do with computers for many years.  My father worked as a technician and worked on televisions and electronics.  I was always interested in electronics and completed an electronics pre-apprenticeship course, and then went on to an electrical apprenticeship.  However I never quite finished my apprenticeship, due to moving to Sydney.  I am particularly fond of mathematics and maths problems and I believe this could translate well to Information Technology.  
		This will not be easy, I have been out of the loop for a while now, however I have discovered I love learning and I know that the first steps are always the most challenging.  I wish to rediscover the love of programming, problem solving, learning and working with technology that I enjoy..  
		I would like to learn a programming language with enough skill to use it competently.  This is the key reason I decided to choose RMIT.  There are many online courses available, however many appear to be simply scams or do not lead onto anything worthwhile.  With RMIT I can plan my learning over many years and take a slow approach.  
		I currently have the best job in the world!  I work for the local council looking after parks and gardens.  Although I love my job it is a very physical job and one that I don’t wish to be doing into my older years.  This gives me up to ten years to learn some IT skills so I can undergo a career change.  I’ve looked at a few “become a hacker” websites in which they all seem to state it takes a long time.
		To which type of career I have not decided but I already have a little knowledge of accounting so it may be financial planning.  I see I can also branch out into many different fields including coding, economics or accounting.  However introduction to IT is one of the first steps to any of these.
