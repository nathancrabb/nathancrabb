			When I was around eight my father brought home a ZX81 computer.  I taught myself to program it using books from the library.  It was incredibly slow so I would set it up to load before school so it would be ready when i got home.  It was also very fragile, if you knocked it hard it would crash, I mainly played a shoot-em up and a block breaker and mucked around with simple programs.  <br>Eventually I graduated to a commodore 64 and then an Amiga and 286, these were in colour and much quicker and advanced.  I was very interested in how these machines worked and loved to copy programs in from various books.  Had a pretty good knowledge of basic, MSDOS and win 3.14.  
		After leaving school I really had nothing more to do with computers for many years.  <br><br>My father worked as a technician and worked on televisions and electronics.  I was always interested in electronics and completed an electronics pre-apprenticeship course, and then went on to an electrical apprenticeship.  How-ever I never quite finished my apprenticeship, due to moving to Sydney.  My brother is currently employed in IT and him and all of his school mates are doing well with good jobs and travelling the world.
		<br><br>I have a strong interest in maths which helped me out in the electrical trade.  I studied math with calculus and statistics in high school.  I am particularly fond of mathematical problems and I believe this could translate well to Information Technology. <br><br>
		
		This will not be easy, I have been out of the loop for a while now, however I have discovered I love learning and I know that the first steps are always the most challenging.  I have only just purchased a laptop at the start of this course and have had the usual struggles with simply setting it up. <br><br> 
		It is difficult to know what to study in the field of IT, with so many choices available and I hope this course will help in finding which path to follow.  I wish to rediscover the love of programming, problem solving, learning and working with technology that I enjoy.  
		<br><br>I would like to learn a programming language with enough skill to use it competently.  This is the key reason I decided to choose RMIT.  There are many online courses available, however many appear to be simply scams or do not lead onto anything worthwhile.  With RMIT I can plan my learning over many years and take a slow approach.  
		<br><br>I  have chosen to follow up this course with an introduction to programming which I hope will give me a clearer picture of what path to follow.  While looking through the ideal job I feel drawn to working in cyber security which requires quite a few skills.
		<br><br>I currently have the best job in the world!  I work for the local council looking after parks and gardens.  Although I love my job it is a very physical job and one that I don’t wish to be doing into my older years.  This gives me up to ten years to learn some IT skills so I can undergo a career change.  I’ve looked at a few “become a hacker” websites in which they all seem to state it takes a long time.
		To which type of career I have not decided but I already have a little knowledge of accounting so it may be financial planning.  I can also branch out into many different fields including coding, economics or accounting.  How-ever introduction to IT is one of the first steps to any of these.
