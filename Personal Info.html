<pre>My Name is Nathan Crabb and I am a kiwi!  Been over the ditch from NZ approximately fifteen years.<br>  
Married with an eleven-year old son, two cats jemma and Boff and a 15 month old Maremma puppy named Teddy.<br>
He is hardly the size of a puppy anymore!<br>
My hobbies include;

	Driving for Uber in my spare time (Its quite often nowadays although I try to restrict it to workday afternoons)
Painting Warhammer miniatures (Never ends – heaps to get through but airbrush helps lots!)
Fixing cars / motorcycles (Almost getting out of control – 5 motorcycles & 4 cars)
The odd run, trip to the gym / pool (I get in for free since I work for council)
Reading (would like to read more – disappointed I spent a whole year on game of thrones and only got to book Four) Also like Asimov, Doctor Who, the Jack Reacher series, 2000AD and all the classics.  Jimmy Barnes book working class boy was the last one and I’m on to working class man now.
Mowing lawns / Gardening for a few regulars (I don’t mow as much as I used too as I find Uber much easier - but people still call occasionally)
Addicted to Fortnite (although working through the Iit course has helped immensely with this)
A member of the mt Druitt Lions club, raising money for various charities and helping the community.  Running your local Bunnings sausage sizzle.
Education  
Have previously studied as an apprentice electrician in New Zealand and I made it to Fourth year including passing the theory and regulations exams.  However, I never got trade qualified and that was almost fifteen years ago.  
I tried university after school but absolutely hated it and probably wasn’t in the right mindset for it at that time.  
Currently licensed to drive heavy rigid truck, excavator, backhoe, bobcat, loader, motorcycle and forklift.  Have a chainsaw, spray, traffic control and first aid certificate also.
Have also completed a certificate 3 in Horticulture.
